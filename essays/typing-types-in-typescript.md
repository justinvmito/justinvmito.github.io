Before enrolling in ICS 314, I have had no experience and next to no knowledge regarding Javascript and Typescript. I had believed that Javascript was essentially the same as Java. Looking back now, I can see how wrong that assumption was.
Recently, I have had the opportunity to learn and experince coding in Javascript, and can now say that this is (mostly) not the case. Now that I am familiar with Javascript, I can say that I dislike it due to its lack of variable types. To me, the ability to assign variables a value of any type, thus forcing the computer to auto-assign types, makes code difficult to read and, personally, less intuitive to work with.
## What about Typescript?
Having declared my gripes with Javascript, I will say that I like Typescript much more. Despite being mostly the same as Javascript, the addition of types makes it more akin to Java, which resolves the complaints I had and places the language closer to my comfort zone. So far, I have not noticed significant differences in functionality between Typescript and Java, so I find Typescript to be a preferable language for use in software engineering.
Now that I am familiar with Typescript, I am able to participate in an athletic approach to software engineering. So far, my experiences have been positive, especially in regards to the practice WODs. I enjoy working out problems, most of the time, and like to try to solve them on my own. 
## Why Operate Dependently (WOD)
However, when I get truly stuck and am unable to figure out how to solve them, I am willing to refer to external sources to do so. That said, it can still be difficult to understand exactly how to do so, as I am often unable to follow the thought process behind the solution these sources present (if they even explain it). I find the WOD videos to be adept at working through the problems step-by-step, in a way that I can follow and understand. At the end, the WODs impart the ability to understand the problem, which makes me more capable of relying upon myself, and not upon AI or the word-by-word solutions of others.
I have found that if I enjoy doing something, I perform better at it than I would otherwise. Seeing my reaction to athletic software engineering, I expect that this approach will prove effective at enchancing my learning and skill development in ICS 314.
